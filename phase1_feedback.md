Nice job! Here are some comments to help you improve:

It is not clear what the difference between the "Home" page and the "Explore" page is. They are essentially displaying the same data. It is also a bit weird that the first page of the app is the login page. You really should allow guests to navigate through your website without being logged in, and only log in upon trying to register for an event, or manually selecting the option to log in.

The event name ("May the force be with you") could have a colored background so that it is more obvious that it really is a button that leads the user back to the main page.

You should give more attention to each "Booth" page (where the user can schedule an appointment), and particularly the content below the "current waitlist: 5" line. The way that the information is displayed is very default and inconsistent with the rest of the website. Perhaps you could switch the "Comments" section with the "Time slots" section. The "Time slots" section clearly needs more fields too, such as the number of guests that will attend the appointment, the pricing (which may or may not vary according to the week day/hour), etc, which is why I think it should be where the "Comments" are instead.

The "Profile" option should be included in the drop-down menu when hovering over the user icon, above "Logout". Also, it is not clear what the "user user" text is supposed to represent. I understand that there is an "Identity" field, but maybe call it something a bit less generic than the lower-cased word "user".

When signing up for an event, you should create one list of users for each timeslot in each booth. This is achieve by having a table "Attendances" with columns "user_id", "booth_id", "timeslot". So when you want to retrieve the list of users attending booth2 at 7pm, you query for the entries that have booth_id=booth2 and timeslot=7pm (or something like that). Ultimately, managers should be able to see this information: they should be able to see the name of the users attending each booth at each time. And they should have more power than just deleting entire timeslots and, instead, deleting specific users from specific timeslots.

<ins>Data:</ins> The placeholder text is currently too generic, which makes it difficult to visualize how things will really work in practice. For instance, the booth description is too placeholder-ish, and the booths themselves don't have proper names. Also, the circular user icon does not match the one displayed on the profile page. Still, you included some sample comments and appointment dates, so I graded this section as Passable.

<ins>Complexity:</ins> it is a tough decision, because we are only allowed to select between "Complex enough" and "Not complex enough", and I'll have to go with the latter. Currently, the only action that a user can do is go on the website, look at the booths, and click a button to attend if desired. This interaction is very superficial, and you must try to come up with more interesting ways to provide benefit to users. How do other booking websites handle the very complex variables that arise when booking something? It's a good idea to take a look at websites such as Booking.com or TripAdvisor.com to get inspiration for your webapp.
